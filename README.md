
# Smart Vehicle System for OverSpeeding Detection

Proposed a system in which speed monitoring of every vehicle can be done and reported
directly to higher authorities. \
The system uses the halleffect sensor to read the current speed of the vehicle
and record the speed and coordinates of the vehicle in the database situated in the cloud. \
The system can then analyse the data to see which vehicles over-speed at which location at what time and generate the map of
the ride where the user can see the over-speeding Statistics of the vehicles. \
Further, the system can be used for two-wheeler vehicles where in cases where parents can track the over-speeding stats of their
children.
